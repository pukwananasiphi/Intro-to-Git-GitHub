# Intro-to-Git-GitHub

Git is a tool that helps you track changes to your code. It's like saving different versions of your work so you can go back if something breaks.
You "commit" your changes to save a version.
You can see who changed what and when.
You can work on different features using "branches" without messing up the main project.
If something goes wrong, you can go back to a previous version.

GitHub is a website where you can store your Git projects online and collaborate with others.
You can upload your code and share it with teammates or the world.
Others can review your code or even suggest changes.
You can open issues to keep track of bugs or tasks.
It’s like social media for coders, but with superpowers.


Terms to remember:
Repository (repo) – your project folder.
Commit – a snapshot of your changes.
Push – send your code to GitHub.
Pull – get the latest code from GitHub.
Branch – a separate workspace to try new ideas.
Merge – bring different branches together.
Clone – copy a GitHub repo to your computer.
